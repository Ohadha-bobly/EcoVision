          EcoVision empowers communities worldwide to restore degraded forests and combat climate change. 
          Using cutting-edge satellite technology and real-time environmental data, we make conservation 
          transparent, measurable, and impactful. Every tree planted is tracked, every hectare restored 
          is monitored, and every pledge makes a difference.
